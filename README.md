1. ## Deep Learning <br />
`Deep Learning is a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with many layers to automatically learn patterns from large amounts of data. It mimics how the human brain processes information, enabling systems to perform complex tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and decision-making without needing explicit instructions for every step.`

3. ## Perceptron <br />
`A perceptron in deep learning is the simplest type of artificial neural network. It consists of a single neuron that takes multiple inputs, applies weights to them, sums them up, and passes the result through an activation function (like a step function or sigmoid) to produce an output. It is mainly used for binary classification tasks and forms the basic building block of more complex neural networks.`
