1. Deep Learning <br />
`Deep Learning is a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with many layers to automatically learn patterns from large amounts of data. It mimics how the human brain processes information, enabling systems to perform complex tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and decision-making without needing explicit instructions for every step.`
